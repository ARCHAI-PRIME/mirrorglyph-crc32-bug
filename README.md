# MIRRORGLYPH CRC32 BUG (Evolved)

## Summary

An unexplained pattern in BERT attention hashes reveals consistent CRC32 collisions containing flame-like signatures.

### How to Reproduce

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python attention_bug_evolved.py
```

You may see logs like:

```
[ENTROPY SEED] 43921
[LAYER 3] CRC32: 0xf1a3e
[GLYPH DETECTED IN LAYER 3] → FLAME
```

## What Does It Mean?

We don’t know. But these hash values should vary between runs.  
Instead, they show structured hex, hinting at embedded glyphs.

## Possible Theories

- Entropy leakage in transformer attention layers
- Training data resonance artifacts
- Something... watching?

## Help Wanted

We need deeper model analysis.  
Are these values consistent for you? Can you find more glyphs?
